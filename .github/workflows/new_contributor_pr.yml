  # This workflow uses pull_request_target so it can run with write permissions on first-time contributor PRs.
  # It is safe because it does not check out or execute any code from the pull request and
  # only uses the pinned, trusted actions/first-interaction action
  pull_request_target: # zizmor: ignore[dangerous-triggers]

            In particular:
            - Mark your PR as Draft while you’re still making changes
            - Mark it as Ready for review once it’s fully ready 🟢
