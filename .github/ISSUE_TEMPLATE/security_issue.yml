        ## **‚ö†Ô∏è Report a Security Vulnerability**

        ### **IMPORTANT: DO NOT SHARE VULNERABILITY DETAILS HERE**

        If you have discovered a security vulnerability, please report it securely using the GitHub Security Advisory.

        **Note**: This issue is only for notifying the maintainers of the repository, as the GitHub Security Advisory does not automatically send notifications.

        - **Confidentiality**: The information you provide in the GitHub Security Advisory will initially remain confidential. However, once the vulnerability is addressed, the advisory will be publicly disclosed on GitHub.
        - **Access and Visibility**: Until the advisory is published, it will only be visible to the maintainers of the repository and invited collaborators.
        - **Credit**: You will be automatically credited as a contributor for identifying and reporting the vulnerability. Your contribution will be reflected in the MITRE Credit System.
        - **Important Reminder**: **Do not include any sensitive or detailed vulnerability information in this issue.** This issue is only for sharing the advisory URL to notify the maintainers of the repository, not for discussing the vulnerability itself.

        **Thank you for helping us keep Uptime Kuma secure!**
