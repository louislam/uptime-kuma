        ## **‚ùó Important: Temporary Suspension of New Feature Requests**

        **At this time, we are not accepting any new feature requests. Existing feature requests will be moved to the backlog and tagged accordingly.**

        - **Reason**: Our current priority is focused on fixing bugs, improving system performance, and implementing essential updates. This temporary suspension will allow us to stabilize the project and ensure smoother management.
        - **What This Means**: During this period, no new feature requests will be reviewed or accepted. However, we continue to welcome feedback, and all suggestions will be reviewed once the suspension is lifted.

        ## **‚ùó Important: Please Avoid Unnecessary Pinging of Maintainers**

        **We kindly ask users to refrain from pinging maintainers unless absolutely necessary. Pings should be reserved for critical issues or urgent matters that require immediate attention.**

        - **Why**: To help maintainers focus on high-priority tasks, we kindly request that unnecessary or repeated pings be minimized. This will help ensure quicker responses for matters that truly need attention.
        - **What This Means**: Non-urgent pings may be ignored or addressed later. Please assess the urgency of your request before pinging a maintainer.
