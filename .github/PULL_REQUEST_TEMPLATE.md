**⚠️ Please Note: We do not accept all types of pull requests, and we want to ensure we don’t waste your time. Before submitting, make sure you have read our pull request guidelines: [Pull Request Rules]**

Check the box below if you understand [x]:

## **❗ Important: Temporary Delay in Feature Requests and Pull Request Reviews**

**At this time, we may be slower to respond to new feature requests and review pull requests. Existing requests and PRs will remain in the backlog but may not be prioritized immediately.**

- **Reason**: Our current focus is on addressing bugs, improving system performance, and implementing essential updates. This will help stabilize the project and ensure smoother management.
- **Impact**: While no new feature requests or pull requests are being outright rejected, there may be significant delays in reviews. We encourage the community to help by reviewing PRs or assisting other users in the meantime.
- **What You Can Do**: If you're interested in contributing, reviewing open PRs by following our [Review Guidelines] or offering support to other users is greatly appreciated. All feature requests and PRs will be revisited once the suspension period is lifted.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we continue to improve Uptime Kuma.
