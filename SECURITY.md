# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Please report security issues to
   <https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/security/advisories/new>.
2. Please also create an empty security issue to alert me, as GitHub Advisories
   do not send a notification, I probably will miss it without this.
   <https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/new?assignees=&labels=help&template=security.md>

Do not use the public issue tracker or discuss it in public as it will cause
more damage.

## Do you accept other 3rd-party bug bounty platforms?

At this moment, I DO NOT accept other bug bounty platforms, because I am not
familiar with these platforms and someone has tried to send a phishing link to
me by doing this already. To minimize my own risk, please report through GitHub
Advisories only. I will ignore all 3rd-party bug bounty platforms emails.
